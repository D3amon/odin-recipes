    <div class="title"><h4>Ingredients</h4></div>
    <div class="box"><ul>
        <li> warm water </li>
        <li> dry yeast </li>
        <li> salt </li>
        <li> bread flour </li>
        <li> extra-virgin olive oil </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class=title><h4>Steps</h4></div>
    <div class="box"><ol>
        <li> Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated. </li>
        <li> Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes </li>
        <li> Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise. </li>
        <li> Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using. </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour. </li>
        <li> Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel. </li>
        <li> Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top. </li>
        <li> With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone. </li>
        <li> Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, and knead on a lightly floured surface for 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Divide dough in half. Roll one half into a 12-inch circle. Place on a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan. </li>
        <li> Spread about 1/2 cup of the pizza sauce over the crust. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese. Top with your favorite toppings. </li>
        <li> Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. </li>
        <li> Follow Steps 5 through 9 to make the second pizza. </li>
